This is the SafetyMails plugin for creating validated forms and providing email verification in real time. Avoid invalid emails!

== Description ==

SafetyForms is the best way to generate quality leads with forms for Wordpress. In addition to creating forms, the emails typed here are validated and verified in real time to avoid invalid leads.

The entire creation process is simple and customizable, from field names to messages displayed when an email is invalidated.

You will have access to:

* Simple and intuitive building interface
* Unlimited fields
* Selector for required fields
* Validation and real-time email verification (using the Safety Optin service)

** Improve your conversions **

Forms are excellent lead generators. Every time someone types an invalid email into your forms, your sales funnel gets hampered, you lose business opportunities and increase your cost per lead.

Form reviews are not enough to prevent invalid emails. Email validation notifies you in real time if a typed email is invalid or non-existent.

You can install the Plugin in two ways:

* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress; or
